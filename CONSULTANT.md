I've spent the last few years designing, automating, and managing infrastructure for small businesses, startups and large organizations. My goal is to leave my clients with a smile on their faces by solving their problems in a timely and professional manner.

I leverage my experiences and skills to understand the problem a client has and execute a solution that solves it. This allows my clients to confidently focus on their business, without worrying about their servers.

I am skilled in the following technologies:  
✅ Cloud Providers: AWS, GCP, and Azure  
✅ Operating Systems: Ubuntu Server and RedHat Server  
✅ Infrastructure as Code: Ansible and Terraform  
✅ Containerization: Docker and Podman  
✅ Container Orchestration: Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and Rancher  
✅ CI/CD: Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, and FluxCD  
✅ Monitoring & Alerting: Prometheus, Grafana, and Alert Manager  
✅ Logs Management: ELK Stack and Grafana Loki  
✅ Others: Python, Bash, ...  

I am confident in my ability to deliver high-quality, secure, and scalable infrastructure in a timely manner. I always strive to improve communication and understanding of my clients' needs.
