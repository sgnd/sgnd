*If you want to become a DevOps Engineer and you are not training with Sugeng Agung Suganda at Bootcamp, you need to ask yourself "Why not?". Take advantage of the online training classes available to you from the comfort of your own home. You won't find a more committed, more caring coach anywhere in Indonesia.* - **Tian Putra N**

*The knowledge I gained was not only about the material that was taught when I enrolled in the DevOps class, but also about the latest technology and tips for dealing with the world of work in the IT world. The material presented by the mentor is clear and relevant so that it could provide an opportunity for Bootcamp participants to understand the basics of knowledge learned while discussing with fellow participants and mentors, and even explore further the technology for those who do not have a background in IT.* - **Nur Mufid**

*As long as Sugeng teaches at Bootcamp, I get a lot of knowledge about DevOps and during the teaching session, if there are questions, he will answer directly.* - **Ikhsandi Fidi**

*As long as I've been studying in the Bootcamp, I felt you explained it briefly and concisely. But there are some moments that feel a bit less efficient when you explain the material. Then sometimes the explanation suddenly jumps out of the line, so there it is the explanation was missing at the time.* - **Gilbran Fairuz M**

*The explanation regarding the material is very compact and clear, providing case studies outside of the Bootcamp material, so it will help improve research skills.* - **Dharma Putra**

Learning while practicing accelerates problem-solving skills, teaches how to automate every job efficiently, and helps in understanding the perspective of the working world in the field of DevOps Engineer.* - **Asep Saepul R**

*As I was taught by Sugeng at Bootcamp, I gained new knowledge about DevOps, how to deal with cloud infrastructure, and anything that could be useful for fast and easy deployment on the server-side. On the other hand, if I had a problem or something I didn't understand, Sugeng could provide help, suggestions, and explanations of why this case was needed and should be done.* - **Achmad Rofiq**

*When he became my mentor at Bootcamp, he was relaxed and friendly, so comfortable that his knowledge was well absorbed.* - **Rizal Darmawan**
